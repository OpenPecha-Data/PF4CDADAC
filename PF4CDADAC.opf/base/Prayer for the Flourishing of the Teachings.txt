Prayer for the Flourishing of the Teachings
A prayer given by a ḍākinī in a vision to Lerab Lingpa

Tulku Namgyal had asked me to write a prayer for causing the teaching of Buddha to flourish
in the Khamgön monastery, and I was just beginning to write when a red ḍākinī appeared and
said: “Wait! When the time comes, I’ll speak it to you!” Time went by, and I was in the Crystal
Cave of Padma in Gyaltö, when that same ḍākinī appeared and this is what she said:
könchok sum dang shakyé gyal
Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and the Lord of the Śākyas, Śākyamuni,
rik sum gön dang mapampa
Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī and Vajrapāṇi, and Maitreya,
neten chenpo chudruk dang
The sixteen Great Sthaviras,
pema jungné den tob kyi
And Padmākara—
lamé kutsé ten gyur chik
Through your power and through your truth, may the lives of the masters be secure!
gendün dé pel tuktün shok
May the Saṅgha increase and dwell in harmony!
tenpé galkyen kün shyi shying
May all circumstances hostile to the teaching be pacified!
shedrub trinlé dargyé shok
May the activities of study and practice grow and spread!

“These words are the mothers’ last advice. There is still much more to this, and it will be
explained, when the time is right.” This is what she said and I, Lerab Lingpa, wrote it down.
