Brief Prayer for Pacifying the Turmoil of the Mamos
by Tertön Sogyal Lerab Lingpa

yeshe ying dang jik ten gyi
All causes of turmoil among the mamos of appearance and existence,
nangsi mamo trukpé gyu
Both mamos of the basic space of wisdom and those of this world—
nyamchak galtrul kong shying shak
All our impairments and breakages, errors and confusions, we confess.
sol lo chö do gyepar dzö
We supplicate you. We make this offering to you. Let it satisfy and delight you.
