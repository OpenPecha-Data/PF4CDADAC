Sādhana of Mañjughoṣa
revealed by Tertön Sogyal

Homage to Mañjughoṣa!
om a ra pa tsa na dhih
Oṃ arapacana dhīḥ
In order to increase your own and others’ intelligence,Practise the six syllables of Mañjughoṣa.Take
refuge, generate bodhicitta and cultivate the four immeasurables.
rangnyi jetsün jampé yang
I myself appear as venerable Mañjughoṣa,
marser raldri lekbam dzin
Orange and holding sword and volume,
ku la dar dang rinchen gyen
Adorned with silks and jewel ornaments,
dorjé kyiltrung pé dar shyuk
And seated in vajra posture on lotus and moon.
tukkar dawa gyepé teng
At his heart, upon a full moon disc
dhih yik ser dok barwa lé
Is the syllable Dhīḥ, gold and blazing,
ö trö sé ché gyal kün gyi
From which light radiates out, gathering intelligence,
sherab yeshe zung kyi go
Wisdom and dhāraṇī doors from all the buddhas and their bodhisattva heirs,
kün kyang özer tsul la dü
In the form of light rays, which gather back
tuk sok dak la yangyang tim
And dissolve again and again into the vital syllables in my heart.

Avoid speaking and recite the six syllables seven hundred thousand times.Through this intelligence
will increase—have no doubt!Samaya! Sealed. Sealed. Sealed.Padma, who is as learned
as I,Clearly revealed this essential practiceWhich accords with the tantras and masters’
instructions.Now, let it be hidden as a precious treasure.May fortunate children of future
generationsEncounter it and bring extensive benefit to beings!
